### An arcade naval arena combat mobile game

Made in my spare time during school, this was my first attempt at a complete mobile game in Unity.
It went through multiple revisions and I learned a lot, mostly:
- how much damn work it is to eradicate bugs. That's one of the major reasons this game was never released, final polish and the BUGS
- data-driven design and being able to define as much as possible in data files for easy tweaking without rebuilds. Enemy stats, how the waves work, what ships are in the waves, etc...
